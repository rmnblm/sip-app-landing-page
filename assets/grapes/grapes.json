        "summary" : "Chardonnay is a versatile and widely planted white grape variety that is popular in winemaking around the world. It originated in the Burgundy region of France but has since spread to many other wine-growing regions, including California, Australia, South Africa, and New Zealand, among others.\n\nChardonnay grapes are known for their adaptability to different climates and soil types, allowing winemakers to produce a wide range of styles, from crisp and unoaked to rich and buttery wines. The flavor profile of Chardonnay can vary depending on the region and winemaking techniques used.\n\nTypically, Chardonnay wines exhibit flavors of green apple, citrus, pear, and tropical fruits, along with notes of vanilla, butter, and toast when aged in oak barrels. The grape itself has a thin skin, which contributes to its ability to take on different characteristics based on winemaking choices.\n\nChardonnay is often used for both sparkling and still wines, and it serves as the base for many renowned sparkling wines, including Champagne. It is also frequently used in blends with other white grape varieties, such as Pinot Blanc or Pinot Gris."
